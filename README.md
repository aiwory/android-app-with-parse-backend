# android-app-with-parse-backend
Simple app, allowing users to register, log in, post photos from galeries and view other user photo feed.
App is deployed on Heroku and uses a Parse backend for data storage.

This app is made by following guidelines on Rob Percival's "The Complete Android Developer Course - Build 14 Apps" course on Udemy.

I modified example app (instagram clone) given in course by seperating login and register activities, allowing users to view their own posted pictures, selecting additional data when displaying pictures and modifying selection so images are selected for user by it's Primary ID not username. Plus some other minor tweaks. There are still a lot of work to do to make the app look somewhat acceptable, but that will come eventually as I improve my developing skills.
